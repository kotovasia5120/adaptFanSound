# adaptFanSound
It is planned to control the speed of all fans in a PC or other device depending on the temperature and noise that each individual fan produces.
  The microphone is used only for preliminary sound level control and is turned off after calibration.
  At first, the user sets the comfortable noise level using the button. Next, the controller measures the noise level of each fan at each speed. Then, in operating mode, the speed of all fans changes, maintaining the overall sound volume of each fan depending on the temperature of the device.
It is possible to control the loudest fan. Or, for example, from the RPM of the video card, maintaining the volume level no higher than on it.
